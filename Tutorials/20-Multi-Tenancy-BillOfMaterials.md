# Learn about Multitenancy and Get an Overview of the Bill of Materials
Multitenancy is the ability to serve multiple tenants from a single deployment and strictly isolating the tenants' data. This significantly reduces costs and efforts.

In the version of Poetry Slam Manager with multitenancy and SAP ERP integration, the Partner Reference Application uses a single deployment to a provider subaccount and subscription to this deployment in subscriber or consumer subaccounts. While the actual runtime of the application resides in the provider account, the subscriber accounts are used for the tenant-specific configuration such as desinations or authorization and authentication. Find an overview of the accounts in the section below.

## Subaccounts
The example setup serves four sample customers: 
-	*Andina Publications*: A well-established publishing house using SAP S/4HANA Cloud enterprise projects to run poetry slam events.
-	*OEC computers*: A company whose employees frequently come together for poetry slams with a great buffet and all-you-can-eat mousse au chocolat. 
-	*Almika Events Cleveland*: An event agency that plans events using SAP Business ByDesign as their ERP solution.
-	*Invictus Live Events*: A small poet startup without any ERP solution yet (but a promising ERP prospect if they stay on their exciting growth journey). 

To develop and run the application for these consumers, the following directory and subaccount structure is proposed.

| Directory Name                   | Subaccount Name                      | Usage                                                                                                       |

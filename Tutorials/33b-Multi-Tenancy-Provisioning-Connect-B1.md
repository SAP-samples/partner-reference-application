# Configure the Integration with SAP Business One

In this section, you integrate Poetry Slam Manager, your SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) solution, with the SAP Business One system of your customer. The Identity Authentication services tenant will act as a corporate identity provider (IdP).

1. Front-end integration:
    1. Launch Poetry Slams and Visitors applications from the SAP Business One launchpad.
    2. Navigate from Poetry Slams to the related SAP Business One purchase order (*Purchase Order* instance).
    3. Use the same Identity Authentication service tenant as a corporate identity provider (IdP) and configure single sign-on for: 
        - Poetry Slams,
        - Visitors, 
        - SAP Business One, Web client, 
        - SAP Business One Control Center, 
        - and SAP Business One Extension Manager.
2. Back-channel integration: Create SAP Business One purchase orders in Poetry Slam Manager using OData APIs with basic authentication.

## Set Up SAP BTP Consumer Subaccount

To start the provisioning procedure, create an SAP BTP consumer subaccount for a specific customer:

1. Open the SAP BTP cockpit (the same global account that hosts the provider subaccount of the SAP BTP application).
2. Create a new *Multi-Environment* subaccount with a name that refers to the tenant number or the customer. 
3. As a provider, choose *Amazon Web Services (AWS)*. In the Poetry Slam Manager example, the subaccount is called *Consumer 1: OEC Computers*. 

### Subscribe To the SAP BTP Multi-Tenant Application

1. In the SAP BTP cockpit (consumer subaccount), navigate to *Instances and Subscriptions*. 
2. Create a subscription to *Poetry Slam Manager* with the *default* service plan (this is the multi-tenant SAP BTP application you just created).

## Set Up Single Sign-On for the SAP BTP Application Subscription

In this tutorial, the Identity Authentication service (IAS) tenant that is used by the SAP Business One system for authentication is reused.  

### Configure Single Sign-On for the SAP BTP Application

Therefore, configure a trust relationship between the SAP BTP consumer subaccount and the Identity Authentication service tenant of SAP Business One as described in [Configure Trust Using SAML 2.0](./25-Multi-Tenancy-Provisioning.md#configure-trust-using-saml-20).

### Launch the SAP BTP Multi-Tenant Application

1. In the *Instances and Subscriptions* of the consumer account, select the *Poetry Slam Manager* application.
2. To launch the *Poetry Slams Manager* application, choose *Go to Application*. Copy the link address of the Poetry Slams application and note it down as **SAP BTP Application Poetry Slams Tenant URL** for later reference.
3. From there, open a fully booked poetry slam and click in the header of the Object Page to *Maintain Visitors*. Copy the link address of the Visitors application and note it down as **SAP BTP Application Visitors Tenant URL** for later reference.

## Configure Single Sign-On Identity and Authentication Management for SAP Business One

In this tutorial, the Identity Authentication service as a corporate identity provider is used to establish a trust relationship between the service provider (the SAP Business One system) and the Identity Authentication service tenant. As a result, SAP Business One delegates user authentications to the Identity Authentication service tenant including single sign-on. 

Below you find more information about how to set up the trust relationship between SAP Business One and Identity Authentication service using SAML 2.0. The e-mail address is used to identify the user.
Therefore, you need to ensure that the same e-mail addresses are entered for users in SAP Business One *System Landscape Directory* and in the Identity Authentication service tenant.

1. Open the SAP Business One *System Landscape Directory* using the URL _https://\<sap-business-one-server:port\>/ControlCenter_.
    > Note: User should be of type *B1SiteUser* with administration access.
2. Open the *Identity Providers* tab. 
3. Choose *Add* to create a new entry in the identity provider list.
	1. Enter the following details in the *Add Identity Provider* window: 
        - *Protocol* = `OIDC` 
        - *IDP Alias* = `b1-psmias` 
        - *IDP Display Name* = `Poetry Slam Manager IAS`
        - The field value of *OIDC Discovery URL* is constructed using the pattern _https://\<sap-business-one-server\>/.well-known/openid-configuration_ 
        - *Claim Name* = `mail`
        - As the *Email Domain*, enter `<domain-name-of-the-email-ids>` (for example, *sap.com*). Make sure that you enter the domain name of the user e-mail ID specific to your use case.
        > Note: *Client ID and Client Secret* are obtained from the application created in the *Identity Authentication service* (see _4. Create a new application in the *Identity Authentication service* admin UI_).

        > Note: Copy the **Redirect URI** field value, which will be used in the creation of a new Identity Authentication service application in the next steps.
   4. Keep the *Add Identity Provider* window open until *Client ID* and *Client Secret* are received in a later step.
4. Create a new application in the *Identity Authentication service* admin UI.
    1. Open *Applications and Resources > Applications*.
    2. Choose *Create* to create a new application.
    3. Enter the following details in the *Create Application* window: 
        - *Display Name* = `B1 Poetry Slam Manager`
        - *Home URL* = `https://<sap-business-one-server>/`
        - *Protocol Type* = `OpenID Connect`
    4. Choose *Create*.
    5. In the *Single Sign-On* properties of the newly created application, select *OpenID Connect Configuration*. 
    6. As *Name*, enter `B1 Poetry Slam Manager`.
    7. In the  *Redirect URIs* section, choose *Add* and enter the **Redirect URI**, which you copied in a previous step.
    8. In the *Post Logout Redirect URIs* section, choose *Add* and enter `\<Redirect URI\>/logout_response`.
    9. Choose *Save*. 
    10. In the *Application APIs* properties of the newly created application, select *Client Authentication*.
    11. In the *Secrets*section, choose *Add*.
    12. In the *Add Secret* window, enter a `Description` and use the default values for the rest of the fields.
    13. Choose *Save*, which will prompt the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* of the application.
        > Note: Make sure that you save *Client ID* and *Client Secret* for later usage since they cannot be retrieved from the system anymore.
    14. Copy the *Client ID* and the *Client Secret*.
    15. Go back to the SAP Business One *System Landscape Directory* *Add Identity Provider* window and enter the *Client ID* and the *Client Secret* to complete the creation of the identity provider in the SAP Business One system.
5. Add users in the SAP Business One *System Landscape Directory*.
    1. Navigate to the *Users* section. 
    2. To add landscape admin users, follow these steps:
        1. Choose *Add*. 
        2. Select the *Identity Provider* created above.

        4. Select the user as *Landscape Administrator*.
        5. Choose *OK*.
        > Note: B1-site-user must be created in the *User Management* of *Identity Authentication service*.
    3. To add business users, follow these steps:
        1. Choose *Add*. 
        2. Select the *Identity Provider* created above.
        3. Enter a business user e-mail in the *User Name* field, which is already available in the SAP Business One system.
        4. Choose *OK*.
        > Note: SAP Business One business user must be created in the *User Management* of *Identity Authentication service*.
6. Bind the users of the identity provider to the users of SAP Business One in the SAP Business One *System Landscape Directory*: 
    1. Navigate to the *Users* section.
    2. Select the business user added in the previous step and choose *Bind*.
    3. Select a *Company* from the drop-down list.
    4. For the *User Code*, you have two options:
	   - Option 1: Select a preexisting user code in the SAP Business One system.
	   - Option 2: Create a new user code in the SAP Business One system and select the newly created user code from the drop-down list. 
    5. Skip all fields that are not mandatory, and choose *OK*.

# Bill of Materials
In the full version of Poetry Slam Manager with multitenancy, SAP ERP integration, and additional features, the Partner Reference Application uses a number of subaccounts and entitlements. These subaccounts include a provider subaccount (to which the application is deployed) and consumer subaccounts (which include customer-specific information and configuration). Find an overview in the section below.

## Subaccounts
The example setup serves four sample customers: 
-	*Andina Publications*: A well-established publishing house using SAP S/4HANA Cloud enterprise projects to run poetry slam events.
-	*OEC computers*: A company whose employees frequently come together for poetry slams with a great buffet and all-you-can-eat mousse au chocolat. 
-	*Almika Events Cleveland*: An event agency that plans events using SAP Business ByDesign as their ERP solution.
-	*Invictus Live Events*: A small poet startup without any ERP solution yet (but a promising ERP prospect if they stay on their exciting growth journey).

To develop and run the application for these consumers, the following directory and subaccount structure is proposed.

| Directory Name                   | Subaccount Name                      | Usage                                                                                             |

## Services Without Entitlements
The list shows services that don't require entitlements.

| Subaccount    |  Entitlement Name                                    | Service Plan              | Type          | Quantity                          | 
| -----------   |  -------------------                                 | ---------                 | ---------     | ---------                         |
| Consumer      |                                                      |                           |               |                                   |
|               | Poetry Slam Manager                                  | default                   | Application   | 1 (partner application)           |
|               | Poetry Slam Service Broker                           | fullaccess                | Instance      | 1 (partner application)           |
|               | Poetry Slam Service Broker                           | readonlyaccess            | Instance      | 1 (partner application)           |

On top of the mentioned entitlements, the connectivity and security services are part of the consumer accounts of the solution.

## Modules

### Running in Cloud Foundry
The application consists of the following modules, which are deployed into the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry runtime of the provider subaccount. 

Provided by SAP:
- Application Router                                                           
- Multitenancy Extension Module                                                  
- Service Broker     

Your main development task:                                            
- Partner Application Module  

### Node Modules
Some open source node modules offered by SAP are used to build the solution. 

Provided by SAP:
- SAP Cloud Application Programming Model on Node.js 
- SAPUI5 with SAP Fiori elements 
- SAP Cloud SDK 
                                                  

# Scaling
To get an overview of how the services scale and how many entitlements you require for an application, here's an example based on the projected use of the Partner Reference Application:

Let's assume a typical data volume of two poetry slams per week (or 125 slams per year), each poetry slam records 200 visits. After three years, if you assume that a visitor books on average two different poetry slams, for 20 subscriptions (customers), this results in a volume of:
 - 7,500 poetry slam events
 - 750,000 visitors and artists
 - 1,500,000 bookings

> Note: The required quantities of most services are calculated on basis of memory, storage or usage counts. The SAP HANA Cloud database bases on capacity units (CU), which considers several factors like memory, CPUs and storage. You can use the [SAP HANA Cloud Capacity Unit Estimator](https://hcsizingestimator.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/) to calculate the required capacity units.

The table below shows how the required quantities scale with typical numbers of customers. The scaling is less than linear. This means the costs per customer decrease significantly the more customers you serve with the multi-tenant application.

# Deploy and Run the Application Including All Features

The tutorial was designed to make it possible for you to follow a step-by-step description of how to develop and deploy Poetry Slam Manager, first as a multitenancy solution. Later, you enhance it with ERP integration and additional features.

If you prefer a quick start without further explanation, but with a deployment of the application with all features, follow these steps:

1. Clone the branch [*main-multi-tenant-features*](../../../tree/main-multi-tenant-features) of the repository in SAP Business Application Studio.

2. [Prepare your provider subaccount for multitenancy deployment](./22-Multi-Tenancy-Prepare-Deployment.md).

3. Enable the entitlements mentioned in the [bill of materials of the multi-tenant application with ERP integration and all features](./01-BillOfMaterials.md).

4. [Deploy the cloned application to your provider subaccount](./24-Multi-Tenancy-Deployment.md).

5. [Provision the tenants of the multi-tenant application to customers in subscriber subaccounts](./25-Multi-Tenancy-Provisioning.md).
